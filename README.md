## Jose Araya --> First-Year – Computer Science Major

## Course Overview
This repository documents my journey through the **Java Object-Oriented Programming** course at [Your Institution], taught by **Professor Gil Salu**. The course focused on fundamental programming concepts using Java, with an emphasis on object-oriented design, logical problem-solving, and building real-world applications through hands-on practice.

## Course Details
- **Instructor:** Professor Gil Salu  
- **Room:** HNS168  
- **Textbook:** ZyBooks: *Early Objects*  

## Topics Covered

### Weeks 1–5: Java Foundations
- Java syntax and primitive data types
- Formatted input/output and math operations
- Working with variables, objects, and methods
- Conditional statements and boolean logic
- Loop structures (for, while, nested)
- Writing custom classes and practicing encapsulation

### Weeks 6–10: Intermediate Concepts
- Arrays and iterative processing
- Sorting algorithms: insertion, selection, merge
- Introduction to inheritance and polymorphism
- Recursive programming and logic flow
- Git and GitHub basics for collaboration

### Weeks 11–12: Advanced Java & Applications
- Generic methods and the Java Collections Framework
- Creating user interfaces using Java Swing and JavaFX
- Event-driven programming and UI customization

## Notable Labs & Assignments
- **Mad Lib Generator** – Practiced user input and string formatting  
- **Driving Cost Calculator** – Applied expressions, methods, and variables  
- **BankAccount Class** – Developed a fully encapsulated class with mutators and accessors  
- **Matrix Multiplication** – Worked with nested loops and 2D arrays  
- **Grocery List Manager** – Used linked lists and collection handling  
- **JavaFX Weather App** – Built a fully functional GUI application using JavaFX

## Assessments
- Weekly quizzes assessing each major concept
- Midterm Exam: Coding tasks + multiple choice questions
- Final Project: GUI-based application demonstrating learned concepts
- Participation through in-class and independent lab submissions

## Tools & Resources Used
- **IntelliJ IDEA** – Java development and debugging
- **ZyBooks Early Objects** – Interactive textbook and lab platform
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and group collaboration
- **Supplemental Resources:** Java documentation, W3Schools, Stack Overflow



## Reflections
This course was a valuable introduction to Java and object-oriented thinking. Through practical labs, coding exercises, and application development, I gained a strong foundation in software engineering principles, preparing me for more advanced programming and real-world challenges.
